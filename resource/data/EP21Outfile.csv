00:02:22.640,00:02:23.470,莞贵人,,,
00:02:24.440,00:02:26.510,这夜深霜重的你怎么也来了,00:02:23.240,00:02:27.300,"Lady Sourire, what brings you here on this frosty night?"
00:02:27.080,00:02:28.390,正因夜深霜浓,,,
00:02:29.040,00:02:30.550,陵容妹妹独步难行,00:02:27.740,00:02:31.660,"The heavy frost makes it hard for Lingrong to walk alone,"
00:02:30.840,00:02:33.190,所以臣妾特来与妹妹做伴,00:02:32.020,00:02:34.560,so I came to accompany her.
00:02:33.800,00:02:35.030,姐姐琴技高妙,,,
00:02:35.560,00:02:37.390,臣妾恐清歌单调,00:02:34.940,00:02:36.820,Sourire is an excellent zither player.
00:02:38.000,00:02:40.110,所以特邀姐姐同来,00:02:36.820,00:02:41.020,I invited her for fear that my singing would be monotonous.
00:02:44.680,00:02:46.790,琴曲相合自然是最好的了,00:02:45.880,00:02:48.760,Singing accompanied by the zither is naturally the best.
00:02:49.280,00:02:50.430,难为莞贵人了,00:02:50.340,00:02:52.040,It's very kind of Lady Sourire to make the trip.
00:02:51.440,00:02:53.950,不知华妃娘娘喜欢听什么,00:02:52.640,00:02:55.540,I wonder what songs Your Highness would like to hear.
00:02:56.440,00:02:59.630,花好月圆人长久 今夜良宵,00:02:57.020,00:03:00.880,"We would offer good wishes on a such beautiful night
with blooming flowers and a full moon."
00:03:01.200,00:03:04.430,就唱支情意缠绵的曲子吧,00:03:02.440,00:03:05.740,Sing a song about the fondness of love.
00:03:13.000,00:03:13.670,是,00:03:14.180,00:03:15.140,Yes.
00:03:28.720,00:03:39.350,小山重迭金明灭,00:03:30.340,00:03:41.060,"As sunlight streams through the bedside folding screen,"
00:03:40.160,00:03:51.030,鬓云欲度香腮雪,00:03:41.060,00:03:50.440,her hair at the temples curls over her snow-white cheeks.
00:03:51.600,00:03:57.070,懒起画娥眉,00:03:52.660,00:03:58.120,"Sleepily she paints her eyebrows slim,"
00:03:57.320,00:04:02.590,弄妆梳洗迟,00:03:58.800,00:04:03.240,taking her time to dress and rinse.
00:04:03.040,00:04:08.350,照花前后镜,00:04:04.280,00:04:09.080,"When she puts on a flower between mirrors,"
00:04:08.640,00:04:14.110,花面交相映,00:04:09.480,00:04:14.300,to tell her face from the flower is difficult.
00:04:14.400,00:04:19.790,新帖绣罗襦,00:04:15.820,00:04:20.880,The new patch on her brocade vest
00:04:20.040,00:04:25.510,双双金鹧鸪,00:04:21.280,00:04:26.200,is two love birds in gold thread.
00:04:25.840,00:04:30.950,新帖绣罗襦,00:04:27.140,00:04:35.320,"The new patch on her brocade vest
is two love birds in gold thread."
00:04:31.400,00:04:48.910,双双金鹧鸪,00:04:38.720,00:04:45.000,Two love birds in gold thread.
00:04:49.400,00:04:50.750,歌倒是好听,00:04:45.580,00:04:49.160,"[a poem by Wen Tingyun, late Tang Dynasty]"
00:04:51.520,00:04:53.550,只是未闻情好之意,00:04:50.240,00:04:54.620,"The song is very nice, but I did not hear the loving feeling in it."
00:04:54.240,00:04:57.590,安常在不是在敷衍本宫吧,00:04:55.280,00:04:59.160,"Attendant An, were you being flippant with me?"
00:04:58.280,00:05:00.710,这首歌虽未直写男女相悦,,,
00:05:01.400,00:05:04.030,可字字写着两心相悦后,00:04:59.460,00:05:06.680,"Although this song doesn't mention love directly, every verse expresses a woman's joy after falling in love."
00:05:04.440,00:05:05.790,女子的欢喜神态,,,
00:05:06.840,00:05:09.310,而且双双金鹧鸪,,,
00:05:10.000,00:05:11.630,也是并蒂成双之意,00:05:07.880,00:05:12.680,"Besides, ""two love birds in gold thread"" symbolize conjugal love."
00:05:12.600,00:05:13.910,既然如此,,,
00:05:14.480,00:05:17.550,安常在怎么就没唱出花好之情,00:05:13.660,00:05:18.360,"If so, why isn't the affection expressed in your singing?"
00:05:19.920,00:05:23.750,难不成是看见皇上跟本宫在一起,00:05:19.920,00:05:24.840,"Ah, did you feel upset seeing His Majesty staying with me?"
00:05:24.160,00:05:25.990,心有不悦才唱不好的吗,00:05:24.960,00:05:27.780,Is that why you didn't sing well?
00:05:31.280,00:05:32.550,回禀华妃娘娘,,,
00:05:33.360,00:05:35.070,安常在早上受了风寒,00:05:32.320,00:05:37.380,"Your Highness, Attendant An caught a chill and has a sore throat today."
00:05:35.440,00:05:36.590,嗓子有些不适,,,
00:05:36.880,00:05:38.070,怎么这么巧啊,00:05:37.780,00:05:39.580,What a coincidence!
00:05:39.280,00:05:41.870,前些日子安常在给皇上唱歌,,,
00:05:42.160,00:05:43.950,整宿整宿地唱,00:05:40.380,00:05:45.180,"In the last few days, Attendant An sang to His Majesty all night every night."
00:05:44.560,00:05:46.110,那嗓子好着呢,00:05:45.600,00:05:47.560,There was nothing wrong with her throat.
00:05:47.000,00:05:48.430,颂芝 是,00:05:48.040,00:05:49.420,"- Song Zhi.
- Yes."
00:05:48.640,00:05:51.070,给安常在倒一杯玫瑰甜酒来,00:05:49.700,00:05:52.300,Bring Attendant An a glass of sweet rose wine.
00:05:52.160,00:05:54.550,你也驱驱寒 接着再唱,00:05:53.200,00:05:55.520,This wine will dispel your cold and you can go on singing.
00:05:54.880,00:05:55.670,是,00:05:55.880,00:05:56.700,Yes.
00:05:59.360,00:06:01.430,娘娘 嫔妾唱歌之时,,,
00:06:02.040,00:06:04.110,不宜饮用甜腻辛辣之物,00:06:00.320,00:06:05.400,"Your Highness, I'm afraid I shouldn't drink
sweet or pungent things when I sing."
00:06:05.480,00:06:08.350,曲儿也不能唱 酒也不能喝,00:06:06.640,00:06:09.560,"[scoffs] You can't sing, nor can you drink."
00:06:09.520,00:06:11.950,论说也是皇上召你们来的,00:06:10.560,00:06:13.940,"By rights, it was His Majesty who summoned you here."
00:06:12.800,00:06:15.630,你们不把本宫放在眼里也就罢了,00:06:13.940,00:06:17.700,"You two may look down on me, but His Majesty..."
00:06:15.880,00:06:17.030,可是皇上,00:06:18.260,00:06:19.500,(clearing his throat)
00:06:20.240,00:06:26.030,既然是华妃娘娘赏赐的 就喝了吧,00:06:21.300,00:06:26.960,"Since Consort Fleur awards it to you...
You should drink it."
00:06:34.080,00:06:34.750,是,00:06:35.220,00:06:36.480,Yes.
00:06:54.400,00:06:56.230,挑一支好早的来唱,00:06:55.600,00:06:58.480,"Now, would you sing us a nice song?"
,,,00:07:13.080,00:07:14.680,(coughs)
00:07:19.000,00:07:20.550,怎么样没事吧,00:07:19.540,00:07:22.000,What's wrong? Are you all right?
00:07:25.360,00:07:26.550,禀皇上和娘娘,00:07:22.260,00:07:23.820,(clearing his throat)

00:07:29.280,00:07:30.550,自然是上上雅音,00:07:28.340,00:07:31.920,It is certainly beautiful when the zither is paired with beautiful singing.
00:07:31.320,00:07:33.470,可有时琴词相合两心相知,,,
00:07:33.720,00:07:34.710,也有清丽之处,00:07:32.340,00:07:35.740,"However, it can also be uniquely beautiful
when the zither is paired with spoken words."
00:07:36.440,00:07:37.550,臣妾能否一试,00:07:37.460,00:07:39.360,Will Your Majesty allow me?
00:07:38.640,00:07:39.270,可以,00:07:39.660,00:07:40.980,All right.

00:10:31.240,00:10:32.150,别哭了,00:10:32.200,00:10:33.880,Don't cry.
00:10:33.320,00:10:37.550,本来嗓子就不好 喝口茶润润,00:10:34.200,00:10:38.300,Your throat is not well. Drink some tea to moisten it.
00:10:38.080,00:10:41.710,姐姐 害你今日跟我一起受辱,00:10:39.000,00:10:43.440,"Sourire, you had to suffer the humiliation today with me."
00:10:43.080,00:10:44.750,今日若不是姐姐在,00:10:44.280,00:10:46.180,"But if you hadn't been there,"
00:10:45.320,00:10:47.110,皇上顾着几分面子,00:10:46.380,00:10:48.520,"to spare me some face in front of His Majesty,"
00:10:47.920,00:10:50.550,我还不知道要受她怎样的折辱呢,00:10:48.900,00:10:52.240,I can't imagine how much more mortified I would be!
00:10:52.760,00:10:54.390,如今皇上重视年羹尧,,,
00:10:55.240,00:10:56.630,华妃亦发得意,00:10:53.600,00:10:57.600,"His Majesty's reliance on Nian Gengyao
inflates Consort Fleur's pride."
00:10:58.400,00:10:59.950,皇上为了顾全大局,00:10:59.380,00:11:01.760,"His Majesty must see to the bigger picture,"
00:11:01.120,00:11:02.430,也不好为了咱们,,,
00:11:02.720,00:11:03.870,太和她撕破脸了,00:11:01.920,00:11:04.500,so he wouldn't fall out with Consort Fleur for our sake.
00:11:04.080,00:11:05.990,只盼着年羹尧能早日离京,00:11:04.800,00:11:07.100,I so wish for Nian Gengyao to leave Beijing as soon as possible
00:11:06.760,00:11:08.190,华妃也少得意些,00:11:07.800,00:11:09.840,and for Consort Fleur's arrogance to be dented a little.
00:11:09.440,00:11:10.550,哪就那么容易,00:11:10.500,00:11:12.240,That won't be easy.
00:11:12.600,00:11:14.790,撇开皇上与华妃的旧情不说,00:11:12.800,00:11:16.620,"Even disregarding the long mutual affection between His Majesty and Consort Fleur ,"
00:11:16.120,00:11:17.910,只要年羹尧在一天,,,
00:11:19.280,00:11:21.990,皇上就不会冷落华妃,00:11:17.200,00:11:23.000,"His Majesty is unlikely to snub Consort Fleur
as long as Nian Gengyao is in favor."
00:11:24.720,00:11:26.670,奴婢奉娘娘之命去翊坤宫,00:11:25.880,00:11:27.920,I went to the Palace of Earthly Honor
00:11:27.360,00:11:29.230,本想说皇后娘娘卧病在床,,,
00:11:29.520,00:11:31.310,明日的赏菊大会就不去了,00:11:28.200,00:11:32.100,"to inform that Your Majesty was ill in bed and wouldn't
be able to attend tomorrow's chrysanthemum assembly."
00:11:31.760,00:11:33.150,谁知听小厦子说,00:11:32.580,00:11:33.920,Who would have thought! Xiao-Xiazi told me that
00:11:33.480,00:11:34.750,莞贵人和安常在,,,
00:11:35.040,00:11:36.670,被华妃当乐伎取乐,00:11:34.140,00:11:37.920,Consort Fleur had bidden Lady Sourire and Attendant An to perform for her.
00:11:37.280,00:11:39.030,奴婢就多事看了一会儿,00:11:38.400,00:11:40.260,"So, I stayed to look on."
00:11:39.560,00:11:41.590,莞贵人和安常在出来的时候,00:11:40.400,00:11:42.740,"When they finished and walked out,"
00:11:42.000,00:11:43.990,神色自若倒也无事,00:11:43.000,00:11:45.340,they looked really composed as if nothing was wrong.
00:11:44.760,00:11:47.110,莞贵人的心性本宫是知道的,,,
00:11:47.440,00:11:48.670,不是急躁之人,00:11:45.800,00:11:49.720,I know Lady Sourire is  not an impetuous person by nature.
00:11:49.880,00:11:53.310,却不想这安常在也忍得住心性,00:11:51.000,00:11:54.620,But I wouldn't have expected Attendant An to be so restrained.
00:11:54.520,00:11:57.070,本宫素日倒是少留意她了,00:11:55.600,00:11:58.140,I should have paid more attention to her.
00:11:57.440,00:11:58.430,那是在外头,00:11:58.300,00:11:59.840,That was when she was out in public.
00:11:58.960,00:12:00.990,回到自己宫里还不知道什么样呢,00:12:00.020,00:12:02.040,I don't know how she would be once back in her palace.
00:12:01.240,00:12:03.550,能忍得住当然是好,00:12:02.160,00:12:05.180,The ability to restrain oneself is always good.
00:12:04.600,00:12:06.790,华妃是骄纵过头了,,,
00:12:07.080,00:12:08.430,肆意轻贱别人,00:12:05.620,00:12:09.280,"Consort Fleur has indulged her arrogance so much
that she recklessly tramples on other people's dignity."
00:12:08.720,00:12:10.870,最终也只会为人所轻贱,00:12:09.540,00:12:12.180,"In the end, she'll only be despised by everyone else."
00:12:11.800,00:12:15.110,倒是这安常在不错呀,00:12:12.720,00:12:16.180,"Anyway, I appreciate how Attendant An's behaved."
00:12:21.360,00:12:22.470,这边这边,00:12:20.960,00:12:24.360,(joyful shouting and laughter) Here! I'm here!
00:12:23.760,00:12:24.870,在这儿呢,00:12:24.780,00:12:26.120,I am here!
00:12:25.800,00:12:27.150,这两枝梅花最好看了,00:12:26.600,00:12:28.220,These two plum branches are the best.
00:12:27.520,00:12:30.070,小主当心啊 抓不着,00:12:28.420,00:12:29.720,"Be careful, My Lady!"
,,,00:12:29.820,00:12:31.360,You can't catch me!
00:12:33.840,00:12:34.550,快点快点,00:12:31.400,00:12:34.800,Come on if you can catch me!
00:12:34.760,00:12:35.630,小主当心哪,00:12:35.700,00:12:37.240,"Take care, My Lady."
00:12:36.840,00:12:37.750,抓不着我,00:12:38.000,00:12:39.380,You won't catch me!
00:12:41.800,00:12:42.750,抓不着,00:12:39.600,00:12:41.040,You can try!
00:12:46.560,00:12:48.150,小主加件衣裳吧,00:12:47.200,00:12:49.760,"My Lady, you should put on a coat."
00:12:49.400,00:12:51.550,这下了雪太冷了,00:12:50.300,00:12:52.800,It's cold and snowing.
00:12:53.080,00:12:55.950,你看这样好的笑声,00:12:54.200,00:12:56.820,I'm listening to their happy laughters.
00:12:56.400,00:12:57.870,我很久都没有早过了,00:12:57.300,00:12:59.900,It's something I haven't heard for a long time.
00:13:06.760,00:13:09.230,莞贵人和安常在送了好些炭来,00:13:07.500,00:13:10.700,Lady Sourire and Attendant An have sent us quite a lot of coal.
00:13:09.960,00:13:11.190,奴婢给您烧上吧,00:13:10.900,00:13:13.280,I'll light the fire for you.
00:13:16.520,00:13:18.670,烧不烧都不要紧,00:13:17.700,00:13:19.920,It doesn't matter.
00:13:19.960,00:13:22.750,暖得了身子也暖不了心,00:13:21.000,00:13:24.140,"The coal can warm your body, but it can't warm your heart."
00:13:29.520,00:13:30.390,小主回来了,00:13:30.620,00:13:32.580,"My Lady, you are back."
00:13:40.560,00:13:42.830,你不是要看院子里的白梅吗,00:13:41.240,00:13:44.020,Didn't you go to see the white plum blossoms in the courtyard?
00:13:43.320,00:13:44.430,怎么那么快就回来了,00:13:44.140,00:13:45.880,Why are you back so soon?
00:13:45.240,00:13:46.910,雪景看久了反倒眼晕,00:13:46.100,00:13:48.420,I got a little dizzy from gazing at the snow.
00:13:47.880,00:13:50.870,四郎本是好意在园子里种植白梅,00:13:48.800,00:13:52.080,"Si Lang, your intentions to plant the white plums in the courtyard were good,"
00:13:51.400,00:13:53.470,可是一下雪反倒与雪景融为一色,,,
00:13:53.760,00:13:54.630,倒看不出来了,00:13:52.400,00:13:55.940,but everything becomes the same color when the snow falls.
00:13:55.960,00:13:57.110,那有何难,00:13:56.900,00:13:58.600,Not a problem.
00:13:58.280,00:13:59.670,你若喜欢红梅,00:13:59.200,00:14:01.640,"If you prefer red plum blossoms,"
00:14:00.720,00:14:03.670,朕再让他们把倚梅园的红梅,00:14:01.640,00:14:05.880,"I'll order some trees from the
Garden of Leaning Plums to be transplanted here."
00:14:03.960,00:14:04.910,移些到宫中来,00:14:06.860,00:14:08.020,Hey!
00:14:07.280,00:14:09.350,你不是让朕专心抄写的吗,00:14:08.200,00:14:10.420,Didn't you ask me to focus on these transcriptions?
00:14:09.760,00:14:11.630,怎么反倒说话来乱朕的心呢,00:14:10.640,00:14:13.000,Now you come back to distract me with your talk.
00:14:12.240,00:14:13.430,哪有这么赖皮的人,,,
00:14:13.920,00:14:15.750,自己不专心反倒赖人家,00:14:13.200,00:14:16.960,I can't believe that you blame me for your lack of concentration!
00:14:16.560,00:14:19.150,若不是方才下棋输了你三招,00:14:17.600,00:14:20.480,"Hadn't you beated me by 3 moves in our Go game earlier,"
00:14:19.720,00:14:21.670,此刻也用不着在这儿受罚了,00:14:20.600,00:14:22.800,I wouldn't have to bear your punishment now.
00:14:22.160,00:14:23.350,四郎一言九鼎,00:14:23.260,00:14:24.760,An emperor's words carry weight.
00:14:24.040,00:14:25.990,可不能在我小女子面前食言啊,00:14:24.800,00:14:27.080,You can't eat your words on doing the transcriptions for me.
00:14:26.800,00:14:27.470,好啦,,,
00:14:28.640,00:14:30.110,嬛嬛不也是在为四郎,00:14:27.800,00:14:29.260,All right.
00:14:30.400,00:14:31.550,裁制冬衣做贺礼吗,00:14:29.800,00:14:32.700,Huan Huan is here sewing Si Lang's winter clothes as a gift.
00:14:34.200,00:14:35.670,食言倒也罢了,00:14:34.700,00:14:36.640,It's not about my promise.
00:14:36.600,00:14:39.470,单为你亲手裁衣的心意,00:14:37.000,00:14:40.480,"Just for your sewing,"
00:14:40.120,00:14:42.670,朕就是抄写三遍也无妨,00:14:41.000,00:14:43.780,I would gladly make three transcriptions.
00:14:43.200,00:14:44.590,这可是四郎自己说的,00:14:43.780,00:14:46.220,"Si Lang, you said this yourself:"
00:14:45.560,00:14:46.870,要替嬛嬛抄入,,,
00:14:47.240,00:14:48.710,所有咏颂梅花的诗词,00:14:46.500,00:14:50.020,you will copy down all the plum poems for me.
00:14:49.240,00:14:50.030,可别反悔,00:14:50.020,00:14:52.000,Do not go back on your words.
00:14:56.040,00:14:58.230,你在这窗上糊了明纸,00:14:56.800,00:14:59.380,You pasted translucent paper on the windows.
00:14:58.640,00:15:00.150,外头的雪光透进来,00:14:59.580,00:15:01.560,"When the snow outside shines through,"
00:15:00.640,00:15:02.350,倒比养心殿还亮堂,00:15:01.600,00:15:03.800,it is brighter than the Hall of Mental Cultivation.
00:15:03.560,00:15:05.350,我不喜欢屋子里暗沉沉的,00:15:04.200,00:15:07.060,I don't like the room to be dim.
00:15:06.240,00:15:09.270,况且一下雨雪 动不动就要点蜡烛,00:15:07.060,00:15:10.600,"Besides, candles have to be lit when it rains or snows."
00:15:09.600,00:15:11.510,气味不好不说 也太费了,00:15:10.600,00:15:12.960,"It is smelly, and also too wasteful."
00:15:12.400,00:15:13.550,你倒肯节俭,00:15:13.260,00:15:15.320,You are quite frugal.
00:15:14.920,00:15:16.430,一入冬旁的不提,00:15:15.700,00:15:18.240,"As soon as winter arrived,"
00:15:17.320,00:15:19.950,单是后宫的烛火钱都添了不少,00:15:18.340,00:15:21.480,the money spent on candles in the harem alone increased a lot.
00:15:20.760,00:15:22.310,虽然不是大数目,,,
00:15:23.160,00:15:24.510,到底是一笔开销,00:15:21.700,00:15:23.860,"Although not a large amount,"
00:15:25.320,00:15:26.750,臣妾那是小家子气,00:15:24.200,00:15:25.900,it is an expense after all.
00:15:27.040,00:15:28.310,难为皇上还看得上,00:15:26.240,00:15:28.020,That’s out of my small-mindedness.
00:15:29.440,00:15:30.590,朕遇见皇后,00:15:28.020,00:15:29.680,It’s unexpected that Your Majesty appreciates it.
00:15:31.080,00:15:32.830,要把这个巧宗也告诉她,00:15:30.400,00:15:32.120,"When I meet the Empress,"
,,,00:15:32.120,00:15:34.440,I will tell her this clever technique.
00:15:34.640,00:15:37.790,后宫的银子能省俭便省俭些,00:15:35.640,00:15:39.420,That would make some savings in the harem.
00:15:39.360,00:15:40.390,快到年下了,,,
00:15:41.120,00:15:43.110,若能省下些银子办个粥厂,00:15:40.300,00:15:42.080,It's almost the end of the year.
00:15:43.360,00:15:45.310,赈济贫民倒也是积德,00:15:42.080,00:15:46.040,"If we can save some money to open a porridge house
for the poor, that will do more good than the candles."
00:15:46.240,00:15:47.910,那便告诉皇后去做吧,00:15:46.340,00:15:49.220,"Right, I will tell the Empress to do so."
00:15:52.800,00:15:53.910,淳小主吉祥,,,
00:15:54.280,00:15:54.910,莞姐姐呢,00:15:54.000,00:15:55.220,Peace to Lady Chun.
00:15:55.120,00:15:55.790,在里面呢,00:15:55.320,00:15:56.660,Where is Sourire?
00:15:57.080,00:15:58.870,小主 皇上也在里面 小主,00:15:56.660,00:15:57.980,She's in chamber.
,,,00:15:58.000,00:16:00.760,"My Lady, she's with His Majesty... My Lady…"
00:16:02.400,00:16:04.110,莞姐姐 莞姐姐,00:16:03.400,00:16:05.100,"Sourire, Sourire!"
00:16:04.520,00:16:05.310,淳儿来了,,,
00:16:05.840,00:16:06.590,皇上吉祥,00:16:05.300,00:16:06.840,Chun’er is here.
00:16:07.360,00:16:08.310,姐姐你瞧瞧,00:16:06.840,00:16:08.240,Peace to Your Majesty.
00:16:08.600,00:16:10.390,淳儿给你摘的红梅花 好不好看,00:16:08.280,00:16:09.620,"Sourire, have a look."
00:16:10.720,00:16:11.390,好看,00:16:09.620,00:16:11.460,I picked these red plum blossoms for you. Aren't they pretty?
00:16:11.640,00:16:13.270,姐姐这里好暖和啊,00:16:11.460,00:16:12.560,"Yes, they are."
00:16:13.600,00:16:14.550,外头可要冻坏人了,00:16:12.560,00:16:14.120,"Sourire, it's so nice and warm here."
00:16:14.760,00:16:15.550,快烤烤火吧,00:16:14.120,00:16:15.600,It is freezing outside.
00:16:16.400,00:16:17.230,皇上您看,00:16:15.600,00:16:16.980,"Here, warm yourself by the fire."
00:16:17.440,00:16:19.470,臣妾给姐姐摘的红梅花好不好,00:16:17.200,00:16:20.640,"Your Majesty, do you like the plum blossoms I picked for Sourire?"
00:16:20.040,00:16:21.910,你姐姐正念叨着红梅呢,00:16:20.800,00:16:22.980,"She was just nagging about red plum,"
00:16:22.280,00:16:23.110,你就来了,00:16:22.980,00:16:24.160,and there you are.
00:16:23.440,00:16:25.670,可不是嘛 臣妾最知道姐姐了,00:16:24.200,00:16:26.900,"Well, I know my sister best."
00:16:26.880,00:16:29.150,淳常在似乎长高了不少啊,00:16:27.700,00:16:30.160,Attendant Chun seems to have grown much taller.
00:16:29.440,00:16:30.190,皇上您忘了,,,
00:16:30.520,00:16:32.270,过了年臣妾就满十七了,00:16:30.260,00:16:33.580,Your Majesty must have forgotten that I'll be 17 after new year.
00:16:33.600,00:16:34.550,别光顾着说话,,,
00:16:34.920,00:16:35.990,快把身上的雪给掸了,00:16:34.600,00:16:36.000,Don't just stand there and talk.
00:16:36.360,00:16:37.110,回头受了风寒,00:16:36.000,00:16:38.120,Brush off the snow quickly before you catch a cold.
00:16:37.400,00:16:38.470,吃药的时候可别哭啊,,,
00:16:40.120,00:16:41.070,还抱着呢,00:16:38.320,00:16:40.400,"Otherwise, you'd cry when you take medicine."
00:16:41.320,00:16:42.230,快叫人插起来,00:16:41.000,00:16:43.340,"So much for showing us the blossoms.
I'll have them arranged in a vase."
00:16:42.560,00:16:43.230,槿汐,00:16:43.460,00:16:44.380,Jinxi.
00:16:44.480,00:16:46.350,姐姐 你那儿不是有个白瓷瓶吗,00:16:45.300,00:16:47.500,"Sourire, don't you have a white porcelain vase here?"
00:16:46.600,00:16:48.030,用来插红梅花最好的啦,00:16:47.580,00:16:49.680,It would be best for the red plum.
00:16:49.440,00:16:50.590,你选的梅花倒好,,,
00:16:50.960,00:16:52.070,都还含苞待放的,00:16:50.300,00:16:52.060,You are good at picking plum blossoms.
00:16:52.360,00:16:53.470,有些日子能开呢,00:16:52.160,00:16:53.360,They are still in bud.
00:16:53.960,00:16:55.190,我就喜欢那个颜色,00:16:53.380,00:16:55.480,It will take a few days before they bloom.
00:16:55.560,00:16:56.750,看得人心里暖暖的,00:16:55.560,00:16:58.340,I like the color a lot. It warms your heart just to look at it.
00:16:58.480,00:16:59.830,我这样为姐姐,,,
00:17:00.320,00:17:01.390,姐姐拿什么赏我呀,00:16:59.400,00:17:02.860,"For the blossoms I picked, what should you reward me, Sourire?"
00:17:03.480,00:17:04.310,没有别的,,,
00:17:04.600,00:17:06.430,小厨房新做的糕点 尝尝吧,00:17:04.260,00:17:05.700,I don't have anything
00:17:06.800,00:17:08.510,太好了 没有比这个再好的了,00:17:05.780,00:17:07.580,but the new pastries my kitchen made.
,,,00:17:07.720,00:17:09.820,Great! There is nothing better than that.
00:17:09.480,00:17:13.070,托你的福 朕也吃点东西,00:17:09.940,00:17:14.280,"Aiya, I have to thank you for finally getting me something to eat."
00:17:14.000,00:17:17.910,你若不来 你莞姐姐只管饿着朕,00:17:14.720,00:17:19.080,"Otherwise, Sourire will not feed me anything."
00:17:18.520,00:17:19.550,我姐姐才不呢,,,
00:17:20.040,00:17:21.750,我姐姐最心疼皇上了,00:17:19.340,00:17:20.960,That’s not true.
00:17:22.440,00:17:24.550,要是姐姐存心饿着皇上,00:17:21.020,00:17:23.280,Sourire cares for Your Majesty the most.
00:17:25.080,00:17:26.550,那定是皇上瞪着姐姐,00:17:23.420,00:17:25.920,The only reason for Sourire to keep Your Majesty hungry
00:17:26.840,00:17:28.310,连吃东西的工夫也没有啦,00:17:25.920,00:17:29.360,would be Your Majesty gazing at her and not having a chance to eat.
00:17:28.520,00:17:31.750,你听听牙尖嘴利必是跟你学的,00:17:29.360,00:17:32.720,Look at her! She must have learned to sharpen her tongue from you.
00:17:32.040,00:17:34.030,吃便吃吧 还堵不上皇上的嘴,00:17:33.000,00:17:35.680,"Eat, the food will keep Your Majesty's mouth busy."
00:17:35.680,00:17:38.150,朕今儿可不是皇上,00:17:36.580,00:17:39.440,"I am not ""Your Majesty"" today."
00:17:38.840,00:17:42.470,朕只当是个寻常富贵人家的公子,00:17:39.680,00:17:43.620,Think of me as a child from an ordinary rich family.
00:17:43.160,00:17:44.550,饶舌几句还不成吗,00:17:44.000,00:17:45.720,Can’t I be a bit garrulous?
00:17:45.160,00:17:46.710,臣妾不敢使唤皇上,00:17:46.040,00:17:48.080,"I dare not dictate to an emperor,"
00:17:47.320,00:17:49.590,可使唤个富家子弟臣妾还是敢的,00:17:48.080,00:17:50.980,but I can push around a wealthy man.
00:17:50.840,00:17:52.390,若这些诗词抄不完,00:17:51.580,00:17:54.040,"If you don't finish copying these poems,"
00:17:53.040,00:17:54.430,今儿的晚膳就别想了,00:17:54.100,00:17:56.220,forget about dinner tonight!
00:17:56.120,00:17:58.790,你听听 你莞姐姐霸道不霸道,00:17:56.960,00:17:59.760,"Did you hear that? Bullying me, isn't she?"
00:17:59.040,00:18:01.950,她是我姐姐 我自然不觉得霸道,00:17:59.760,00:18:03.340,She's my sister. I don't feel that way.
00:18:03.800,00:18:06.830,你得磨墨 你不磨墨朕便不写,00:18:04.860,00:18:08.880,"You have to grind the ink, or I won't write."
00:18:23.960,00:18:25.390,臣妾原想不明白,,,
00:18:25.800,00:18:27.350,为什么看着皇上和姐姐,00:18:24.800,00:18:29.560,"I was wondering why this scene looks familiar to me
when Your Majesty banters with Sourire."
00:18:27.680,00:18:28.790,在一起的样子很眼熟,,,
00:18:29.320,00:18:30.670,原来臣妾的姐姐,,,
00:18:31.000,00:18:32.590,在家和姐夫也是这个样子的,00:18:30.060,00:18:33.540,"Now I see. My own sister
and her husband were just like this at home."
00:18:33.120,00:18:34.710,一个磨墨 一个写字,00:18:33.560,00:18:35.520,She grinds the ink while he writes.
00:18:35.080,00:18:35.870,点心吃多了,,,
00:18:36.200,00:18:37.430,快喝口茶润润吧,00:18:35.920,00:18:37.220,You ate a lot of snacks.
00:18:37.840,00:18:39.590,你怎么不让她把话说完呢,00:18:37.220,00:18:38.360,Drink some water.
00:18:41.320,00:18:42.470,你只说便是,00:18:38.820,00:18:40.860,Why don't you let her finish?
00:18:42.800,00:18:44.470,皇上净爱听这些不正经的话,00:18:41.980,00:18:43.600,Go on.
00:18:45.600,00:18:48.030,以前臣妾的姐姐和姐夫在一起,00:18:43.760,00:18:45.760,Your Majesty loves to listen to such playful words.
00:18:48.360,00:18:50.230,虽然不说话却要好得很,00:18:46.760,00:18:50.940,"My sister and her husband always have a great time
together even without exchanging a word."
00:18:51.000,00:18:54.510,臣妾的额娘管这叫 叫,00:18:51.200,00:18:54.380,My mother called it ...
,,,00:18:54.700,00:18:55.740,Hmm...
00:18:55.680,00:18:57.830,额娘说这是闺房之乐,00:18:56.520,00:18:59.060,"Ah, yes! ""Intimacy in the boudoir""."
00:18:59.400,00:19:00.430,淳儿小小年纪,,,
00:19:00.760,00:19:01.950,哪儿听来的这些浑话,00:19:00.520,00:19:03.400,Where did you hear these risqué words at such a young age?
00:19:02.320,00:19:03.230,一味地胡说八道,,,
00:19:04.160,00:19:05.590,皇上竟还这样纵着她,00:19:03.400,00:19:05.400,Stop talking nonsense.
00:19:06.240,00:19:08.630,皇上您说臣妾是胡说吗,00:19:05.420,00:19:07.500,And Your Majesty must stop indulging her.
,,,00:19:07.660,00:19:09.840,"Your Majesty, was I talking nonsense?"
00:19:09.040,00:19:10.110,当然不是,00:19:10.100,00:19:11.360,Of course not.
00:19:10.560,00:19:12.630,你说的是极好的话,00:19:11.540,00:19:14.240,Your words are ... absolutely brilliant.
00:19:14.160,00:19:16.750,朕和嬛嬛自当如此,00:19:15.040,00:19:18.360,Huan Huan and I should be just like that.

00:19:24.560,00:19:25.390,小主啊,00:19:25.520,00:19:26.980,"My Lady,"
00:19:25.960,00:19:28.110,待会儿咱们就要进养心殿了,00:19:27.060,00:19:29.340,We are entering the Hall of Mental Cultivation in a moment.
00:19:28.480,00:19:30.150,您可千万别害怕,00:19:29.420,00:19:31.420,Please do not be afraid.
00:19:33.800,00:19:35.390,奴才伺候这么多小主了,00:19:31.840,00:19:33.300,(giggles)
00:19:35.760,00:19:38.150,头一个见到像您这么爱笑的,00:19:33.860,00:19:39.340,"I've served many concubines before,
but none laughed as much as you do."
00:19:39.720,00:19:40.710,慢点慢点,00:19:40.380,00:19:42.380,Slow down. Slow down.
00:19:46.960,00:19:48.950,朕在莞贵人那儿看到,,,
00:19:49.360,00:19:50.990,她以明纸糊窗采光,,,
00:19:52.040,00:19:54.150,可省了宫中不少烛火之费,00:19:47.780,00:19:55.160,"I noticed Lady Sourire was using translucent paper
on her windows, which saves a lot of money on candles."
00:19:55.000,00:19:56.030,皇后以为如何,,,
00:19:57.160,00:19:58.630,京中冬日漫长,00:19:55.780,00:19:58.100,What do you think?
00:19:58.880,00:20:00.310,莞贵人此举很有用,00:19:58.160,00:19:59.900,"For Beijing's long winter,"
00:20:00.920,00:20:03.670,年节下正是处处要用银子的时候,00:19:59.900,00:20:01.900,Lady Sourire's method is very useful.
00:20:04.560,00:20:06.790,能省下些自然很好,00:20:01.900,00:20:07.540,It's good to save money whenever possible as the year end approaches.
00:20:07.000,00:20:09.470,朕一直以为她的聪慧才学,,,
00:20:09.800,00:20:10.950,皆在诗书之上,00:20:07.920,00:20:12.220,I always thought that her best talents were in poetry and literature.
00:20:11.680,00:20:13.990,不想还有主事之才,00:20:12.720,00:20:15.460,I overlooked her talent for household management.
00:20:14.840,00:20:16.550,倒是朕小觑她了,00:20:15.780,00:20:18.140,I did underestimate her.
00:20:17.560,00:20:19.070,莞贵人一点即透,,,
00:20:19.640,00:20:21.430,自然要学什么都不难,00:20:18.480,00:20:22.380,Noble Lady Sourire is intelligent and able to learn anything easily.
00:20:21.840,00:20:25.150,更难得的是她有一点慈心,00:20:22.600,00:20:26.320,What's more precious is her kindness.
00:20:26.280,00:20:29.190,想到要用省下的银子去开粥厂,00:20:27.360,00:20:30.820,She wants to open a food relief center using the money saved.
00:20:30.040,00:20:32.510,假以时日可成大器呀,00:20:31.140,00:20:33.620,She can do great things in the future.
00:20:35.280,00:20:38.750,早说皇上昨晚召幸了淳常在,00:20:36.340,00:20:40.820,I heard that Your Majesty called for Attendant Chun last night.
00:20:45.480,00:20:47.230,你看过敬事房的档了,00:20:46.480,00:20:48.780,You reviewed the log of Attendance Services?
00:20:49.040,00:20:51.870,淳常在入宫已有两年了吧,00:20:50.080,00:20:53.180,Attendant Chun has been in the harem for two years
00:20:52.200,00:20:54.110,如今也出落成大姑娘了,00:20:53.180,00:20:55.280,and grown up into a lovely lady.
00:20:54.400,00:20:56.510,臣妾记得她喜欢吃甜食,00:20:55.340,00:20:57.740,I remember that she had a sweet tooth
00:20:57.120,00:20:59.750,又爱穿些俏皮颜色的衣裳,00:20:57.740,00:21:01.120,and loved to dress in bright colors.
00:21:01.320,00:21:03.470,所以早上派人送去了些,00:21:02.100,00:21:04.860,So this morning I sent her some sweets and bright clothes.
00:21:04.360,00:21:06.950,她是小孩子 心性多少爱娇些,00:21:05.100,00:21:08.520,She is light-hearted and a child at heart.
00:21:08.280,00:21:10.030,小女孩爱娇是好,00:21:09.240,00:21:11.500,"It's good for a young girl to be light-hearted,"
00:21:10.520,00:21:12.910,如今是名副其实的嫔妃了,00:21:11.500,00:21:13.760,but now she is truly a concubine.
00:21:13.240,00:21:15.710,至少也该端庄大方些,00:21:14.120,00:21:17.320,She should be at least be more decorous and sedate.
00:21:16.600,00:21:18.950,朕就是喜欢她率性可爱,00:21:17.560,00:21:20.020,I like her candid nature.
00:21:20.280,00:21:24.150,不像有些人处处挑衅 叫朕心烦,00:21:20.840,00:21:25.420,Unlike those having a provocative nature who upset me.
,,,00:21:26.760,00:21:28.500,(sighs)
00:21:29.040,00:21:31.790,启禀皇上 张廷玉大人到,00:21:30.080,00:21:33.440,"Your Majesty, Zhang Tingyu is here."
00:21:32.920,00:21:34.070,让他稍候片刻,,,
00:21:34.400,00:21:35.070,嗻,00:21:33.800,00:21:35.340,I'll be with him in a moment.
,,,00:21:35.340,00:21:36.340,Yes.
00:21:36.880,00:21:38.910,那臣妾也先行告退了,00:21:37.280,00:21:40.220,"Your Majesty, allow me to take my leave."
00:21:44.400,00:21:47.590,年羹尧在京中一切可还安好,00:21:46.060,00:21:49.220,Is everything all right with Nian Gengyao in Beijing?
00:21:48.440,00:21:51.150,迎来送往十分热闹,00:21:49.280,00:21:52.680,He is really busy entertaining guests.
00:21:52.240,00:21:54.990,他在京中有故旧倒也寻常,00:21:53.300,00:21:56.300,It's not odd that he has some old friends in Beijing.
00:21:55.560,00:21:57.590,皇上恕妾直言,00:21:56.480,00:21:58.920,"Your Majesty, please excuse my bluntness."
00:21:58.040,00:22:01.070,迎来送往的都是他门下之人,00:21:59.060,00:22:02.120,The guests are all his subordinates.
00:22:01.360,00:22:04.190,其余官员他看也不看,00:22:02.340,00:22:05.820,He wouldn't even look at any other officials.
00:22:05.600,00:22:06.270,你说,00:22:06.460,00:22:07.780,Go on.
00:22:06.680,00:22:08.830,年羹尧这次进京参见,00:22:07.780,00:22:09.840,"During his trip, en route to Beijing"
00:22:09.040,00:22:11.990,赴京途中他命都统范时捷,00:22:10.100,00:22:13.340,"Nian Gengyao ordered Banner General Fan Shijie
and Zhili Governor Li Weijun"
00:22:12.240,00:22:15.150,直隶总督李维钧跪道迎送,00:22:13.340,00:22:16.420,to kowtow upon his arrivals and departures.
00:22:15.560,00:22:17.510,到京时车马显赫,00:22:16.660,00:22:18.820,He led an ostentatious procession entering Beijing.
00:22:18.160,00:22:20.110,王府以下官员跪接,00:22:18.900,00:22:21.360,Officials below the Princes kneeled to receive him
00:22:20.400,00:22:22.070,年羹尧安然骑在马上,,,
00:22:22.480,00:22:23.550,连看都不看一眼,00:22:21.360,00:22:24.460,"while he sat impassively on the horse,
without even looking at them."
00:22:23.800,00:22:26.590,他这样骄狂 令人侧目,00:22:24.540,00:22:27.700,Many glanced at him sideways.
00:22:26.960,00:22:27.870,有这等事,00:22:27.960,00:22:29.280,Was it really like that?
00:22:28.640,00:22:30.390,微妾不敢妄言,00:22:29.700,00:22:32.020,I dare not tell an untruth to Your Majesty.
00:22:31.120,00:22:34.470,年羹尧得胜归来衣锦还乡,00:22:32.240,00:22:36.000,"As Nian Gengyao won a victory and returned in glory,"
00:22:36.440,00:22:41.030,难免得意过头 朕会提醒他,00:22:37.600,00:22:40.240,it's understandable that he felt excessive pride.
,,,00:22:40.240,00:22:41.740,I'll warn him.
00:22:41.360,00:22:45.550,有皇上此言 微妾就心安了,00:22:42.460,00:22:46.640,I feel reassured hearing Your Majesty's saying so.
00:22:46.680,00:22:48.190,你们户部事情多,00:22:47.440,00:22:49.720,You are burdened with much work at the Ministry of Revenue.
00:22:48.680,00:22:50.150,年羹尧懂边事,00:22:49.820,00:22:51.720,"As Nian Gengyao is familiar with border affairs,"
00:22:50.640,00:22:53.070,有什么事情可以与他商量,00:22:51.920,00:22:54.520,you can consult with him if you have any questions.
00:22:53.600,00:22:55.710,记住商量即可,00:22:54.660,00:22:57.240,"But remember, only consult."
00:22:56.600,00:22:59.550,年羹尧门下之人若不尽忠职守,00:22:57.580,00:23:00.720,"If his subordinates aren't loyal to their posts,"
00:22:59.880,00:23:02.070,反而借端生事作威作福,00:23:00.940,00:23:03.580,"and instead, abuse their power and create disturbances,"
00:23:02.640,00:23:04.030,你可立即参奏,,,
00:23:04.560,00:23:06.630,朕会重惩决不姑息,00:23:03.860,00:23:05.880,you can present a memorandum to me immediately.
,,,00:23:05.880,00:23:08.340,I will punish them severely without leniency.
00:23:08.920,00:23:10.750,过几天就是年下了,00:23:09.920,00:23:12.600,The lunar new year is around the corner.
00:23:12.040,00:23:15.470,宫里年节的赏赐下来了吗,00:23:13.020,00:23:16.420,Has the year-end bonus arrived?
00:23:16.200,00:23:16.990,下来了,00:23:17.400,00:23:18.700,Yes.
00:23:17.560,00:23:20.310,不过内务府的人说,00:23:18.840,00:23:21.420,"However, the Household Department said"
00:23:20.560,00:23:21.910,皇上下令节省开销,00:23:21.480,00:23:23.440,that His Majesty ordered to reduce expenses.
00:23:22.440,00:23:25.070,所以今年的赏银只有往年的一半,00:23:23.500,00:23:26.700,So they halved the bonus this year.
00:23:26.280,00:23:28.950,每逢年节 本宫就要大兴赏赐,00:23:27.360,00:23:30.520,I always reward the servants generously every new year.
00:23:29.520,00:23:33.070,足足加上一倍都不够还要减半,00:23:30.680,00:23:33.900,Doubling the amount is yet short.
00:23:33.760,00:23:34.990,不是杯水车薪了,00:23:34.900,00:23:36.600,"Half the amount is ""a cup of water to a burning carriage""."
00:23:35.400,00:23:37.790,就是 今年不同往处,00:23:36.660,00:23:37.560,Exactly.
00:23:38.080,00:23:39.390,大将军在京中过年,00:23:37.660,00:23:40.640,"Unlike before, the Great General will spend this new year in Beijing."
00:23:39.800,00:23:42.110,咱们要赏的银子就更多了,00:23:40.860,00:23:43.260,We have to give out more rewards.
00:23:42.560,00:23:44.470,要宫里的人早话信服,00:23:43.320,00:23:45.760,"If you want the Palace staff to be obedient,"
00:23:44.880,00:23:46.230,威信是一回事,,,
00:23:46.680,00:23:48.310,皇上的恩宠是一回事,00:23:45.840,00:23:49.780,you must have prestige and His Majesty’s favor.
00:23:49.080,00:23:52.270,最重要的就是要银子赏下去,00:23:50.300,00:23:53.280,"But most importantly, it's the amount of money you reward."
00:23:52.600,00:23:54.750,人家才肯实实在在地为你做事,00:23:53.560,00:23:55.920,That's what makes them genuinely work for you.
00:23:55.080,00:23:58.070,其实娘娘大可向大将军开口要的,00:23:56.100,00:23:59.020,Perhaps Your Highness can ask the Great General for some help.
00:23:58.520,00:24:00.150,这些年哥哥在外头,,,
00:24:00.440,00:24:02.350,明里暗里地接济了本宫不少,00:23:59.520,00:24:03.640,"These years, my brother has both openly and secretly
given me  much financial support."
00:24:02.920,00:24:04.470,不然就靠这点月例银子,,,
00:24:04.760,00:24:05.870,十天都撑不住,00:24:04.040,00:24:07.480,"Otherwise, I can’t get through even ten days
with this tiny amount of monthly stipend."
00:24:06.680,00:24:08.830,可是一味地向娘家伸手,,,
00:24:09.520,00:24:10.590,也不是个事啊,00:24:07.600,00:24:11.700,"But I can't keep ""holding out my hand"" to my family."
00:24:11.840,00:24:14.390,其实娘娘想赚些体己并不难,00:24:12.640,00:24:16.880,"Actually, it would not be difficult if Your Highness
wants to have some private earnings."
00:24:16.240,00:24:17.110,你有法子,,,
00:24:17.680,00:24:19.070,奴婢早宫里的人说,00:24:17.200,00:24:18.620,What’s your idea?
00:24:19.360,00:24:20.430,大将军回京以后,00:24:18.780,00:24:21.540,"They say that since the General came back to Beijing,"
00:24:20.680,00:24:22.750,想要拜见求官的人多得不得了,00:24:21.680,00:24:23.900,flocks of people have been eager to pay him a formal visit.
00:24:23.080,00:24:25.150,只可惜大将军没空见他们,00:24:24.060,00:24:26.400,"Unfortunately, the Great General is too busy to see them."
00:24:25.440,00:24:27.510,这些人正急得跟没头苍蝇似的,00:24:26.520,00:24:28.620,These people have been as anxious as headless chickens
00:24:27.840,00:24:28.950,不知道该怎么办呢,,,
00:24:29.400,00:24:30.790,若是娘娘肯帮他们,00:24:28.620,00:24:30.080,not knowing what to do.
00:24:31.120,00:24:32.830,在大将军面前说上两句话,00:24:30.340,00:24:33.880,"If Your Highness was willing to  put in a good word
to the Great General on their behalf,"
00:24:33.400,00:24:34.910,那他们自然也就知道,,,
00:24:35.320,00:24:36.430,怎么孝敬娘娘了,00:24:34.080,00:24:37.580,they will certainly know how to pay Your Highness back.
00:24:37.320,00:24:38.430,有这样的好事,00:24:38.340,00:24:39.900,Is that really so easy?
00:24:39.280,00:24:41.790,皇上开考科举是为了选拔人才,00:24:40.440,00:24:42.800,The imperial examination aims at selecting talents.
00:24:42.040,00:24:44.510,这些人毛遂自荐也是为了前程,00:24:43.140,00:24:45.760,These people offer their services for brighter prospects.
00:24:45.160,00:24:46.390,若是真有好的,,,
00:24:46.600,00:24:48.390,让大将军举荐给皇上,00:24:46.180,00:24:49.740,"If some of them are really good
and the General recommends them to His Majesty,"
00:24:48.880,00:24:51.230,那也是娘娘的一份功劳啊,00:24:49.940,00:24:52.580,Your Highness also shares part of the merit.
00:24:51.640,00:24:53.990,皇上不许后宫妄议朝政,00:24:52.840,00:24:56.040,His Majesty forbids the harem to be pass comment on political affairs...
00:24:55.520,00:24:56.950,他们要见哥哥,00:24:56.620,00:24:58.800,"If they want to see my brother,"
00:24:58.160,00:25:00.030,本宫传句话是能的,00:24:58.900,00:25:01.420,I can certainly pass a word for them.
00:25:01.080,00:25:04.590,至于用与不用那得听哥哥的,00:25:02.320,00:25:06.160,"Whether they are selected or not, it’s up to my brother."
00:25:06.240,00:25:07.270,娘娘英明,00:25:07.160,00:25:08.980,"That is very wise, Your Highness."
00:25:10.880,00:25:13.350,小主这件寝衣拆了缝缝了拆,,,
00:25:13.680,00:25:14.510,都好几遍了,00:25:12.340,00:25:15.500,"My Lady, you have removed the stitches
and corrected the sewing back and forth many times."
00:25:14.840,00:25:15.870,怎么还没有缝好,00:25:15.740,00:25:17.720,Haven’t you finished it yet?
00:25:17.440,00:25:19.670,给皇上的要好好做,00:25:18.640,00:25:21.360,It’s for His Majesty. It must be done perfectly.
00:25:24.800,00:25:27.030,小主前儿着了风寒,00:25:25.960,00:25:27.960,"My Lady, you have been coughing non-stop"
00:25:27.320,00:25:28.390,就一直咳嗽着,00:25:27.960,00:25:30.100,since you caught a cold a few days ago.
00:25:30.520,00:25:32.350,皇上有好些日子没来了吧,00:25:30.800,00:25:33.380,"It's quite a few days since His Majesty last visited, isn't it?"
00:25:32.640,00:25:33.710,有一个多月了,,,
00:25:34.360,00:25:35.910,皇上不是在华妃娘娘那儿,00:25:33.380,00:25:35.140,More than a month.
00:25:36.280,00:25:37.310,便是在莞贵人那儿,00:25:35.540,00:25:38.780,His Majesty is either with Consort Fleur or Lady Sourire.
00:25:38.240,00:25:39.710,华妃娘娘风头正盛,,,
00:25:40.200,00:25:41.350,我不能跟她争,00:25:39.380,00:25:41.240,Consort Fleur is getting all the glory.
,,,00:25:41.240,00:25:42.680,I can’t compete with her.
00:25:42.240,00:25:45.990,也是 可是皇上既然看了莞贵人,00:25:43.700,00:25:47.120,"That makes sense. But when His Majesty visits Lady Sourire,"
00:25:46.520,00:25:48.110,莞贵人和小主要好,,,
00:25:48.600,00:25:51.190,怎么也要提醒皇上来看看小主吧,00:25:47.520,00:25:52.340,"she should have reminded His Majesty to see you, My Lady."
00:25:51.880,00:25:52.870,皇上没有来,00:25:52.900,00:25:54.060,His Majesty didn’t come.
00:25:53.480,00:25:55.070,大约姐姐也没有提吧,00:25:54.220,00:25:56.100,Maybe Sourire didn’t say anything.
00:25:55.480,00:25:58.550,奴婢早说最近皇上召幸了淳常在,00:25:56.620,00:25:59.780,I heard that Attendant Chun served His Majesty recently.
00:25:59.000,00:26:01.470,淳常在得宠后还是老样子,,,
00:26:01.840,00:26:02.750,爱说爱闹的,00:26:00.260,00:26:03.920,She's still lively and noisy as before even after she gained favor.
00:26:03.960,00:26:05.230,皇上未必有心,,,
00:26:05.600,00:26:07.350,这大概是皇后的主意吧,00:26:04.940,00:26:06.700,Perhaps it wasn't His Majesty's intention to favor her.
00:26:07.960,00:26:09.670,这也就是皇后的好处了,00:26:06.720,00:26:08.660,It might have been the Empress's idea.
,,,00:26:09.220,00:26:11.360,Her Majesty's always kind like that.
00:26:10.120,00:26:13.110,处处周全 人人的心思她都顾到,00:26:11.460,00:26:14.120,She’s considerate to everyone.
00:26:13.760,00:26:16.990,只是华妃娘娘一直欺负小主,00:26:14.860,00:26:18.260,"But Consort Fleur keeps bullying you, My Lady."
00:26:17.640,00:26:20.110,皇后娘娘有心也照顾不到啊,00:26:18.500,00:26:21.580,Her Majesty can hardly take care of you despite her kind heart.
00:26:23.280,00:26:24.870,小主你早点休息吧,00:26:24.380,00:26:25.900,"My Lady, please go to rest early."
00:26:25.200,00:26:27.070,奴婢明日一早就请太医过来,00:26:26.060,00:26:28.060,I'll bring an imperial doctor early tomorrow morning.
00:26:27.360,00:26:28.950,明日再说吧你先下去,00:26:28.060,00:26:30.080,All right. You can go now.
00:26:29.640,00:26:30.350,是,00:26:30.460,00:26:31.280,Yes.
00:26:31.280,00:26:32.070,对了,00:26:32.300,00:26:33.440,"Oh,"
00:26:32.840,00:26:34.790,今天就不必替我收拾床铺了,00:26:33.700,00:26:35.840,you don’t need to make the bed for me today.
00:26:35.640,00:26:36.390,是,00:26:36.760,00:26:38.160,Yes.
00:26:54.080,00:26:55.150,华妃,00:26:54.980,00:26:56.860,Consort Fleur ...
00:27:03.520,00:27:04.830,去死,00:27:04.500,00:27:06.540,Go to hell!
00:27:08.760,00:27:10.630,皇后娘娘万福金安,00:27:09.900,00:27:12.080,Peace and grace to Your Majesty.
00:27:11.600,00:27:12.670,都起来坐吧,,,
00:27:13.040,00:27:13.870,谢谢娘娘,00:27:12.660,00:27:13.920,All rise and take a seat.
,,,00:27:14.120,00:27:15.680,I thank Your Majesty.
00:27:17.400,00:27:19.030,这两日天寒风大,00:27:18.400,00:27:20.340,It's been cold and very windy lately.
00:27:19.480,00:27:22.070,难为你们还能那么早向本宫请安,00:27:20.600,00:27:23.780,It is kind of you to come to greet me this early.
00:27:23.080,00:27:24.870,本想和安妹妹一起来的,00:27:24.200,00:27:26.180,"I was hoping to come with Lingrong,"
00:27:25.280,00:27:27.390,只因安妹妹身子不爽不能吹风,00:27:26.220,00:27:28.580,but she's not feeling well and can't bear the wind.
00:27:27.680,00:27:29.150,便和淳常在一起来了,00:27:28.800,00:27:30.480,So I came with Attendant Chun.
00:27:29.560,00:27:31.670,淳常在出落得越发好了,00:27:30.660,00:27:32.700,Attendant Chun is even prettier than I last saw her.
00:27:31.960,00:27:33.230,皇上可对你好吗,,,
00:27:33.560,00:27:34.550,皇上可疼爱臣妾了,00:27:32.860,00:27:34.020,How was His Majesty to you?
00:27:34.920,00:27:35.430,嘱咐御膳房,00:27:34.060,00:27:35.620,His Majesty likes me a lot.
00:27:35.680,00:27:37.830,每日都做好多好吃的糕点给臣妾,00:27:35.820,00:27:38.800,He ordered the Imperial Kitchen to cook plenty of delicious pastries for me daily.
00:27:38.120,00:27:38.870,那就好,00:27:39.040,00:27:40.200,That's good.
00:27:39.560,00:27:42.150,你现在呀 已经是皇上的嫔妃了,00:27:40.560,00:27:43.160,You are now a concubine of His Majesty.
00:27:42.480,00:27:44.670,以后处处都要想着皇上的事,00:27:43.380,00:27:45.760,You will always need to give priority to His Majesty.
00:27:44.880,00:27:45.470,明白吗,,,
00:27:46.120,00:27:46.870,皇后娘娘,00:27:45.920,00:27:47.100,Do you understand?
00:27:48.120,00:27:49.750,臣妾有个小小的请求,00:27:47.260,00:27:50.940,Um ... May I ask Your Majesty for a tiny favor?
00:27:50.200,00:27:51.550,不知娘娘能不能答应,00:27:51.200,00:27:53.160,I wonder whether Your Majesty will agree.
00:27:53.000,00:27:53.870,说吧,,,
00:27:54.880,00:27:56.750,臣妾想和莞姐姐住在一起,00:27:54.060,00:27:55.300,Go ahead.
00:27:57.360,00:27:59.510,以前搬出去是要避讳姐姐的病,00:27:55.880,00:27:58.260,I want to live with Sourire.
00:27:59.880,00:28:01.630,可是现在姐姐都好了这么久了,00:27:58.500,00:28:02.720,"I moved out when she was ill, but now
Sourire has been cured for a long time."
00:28:02.000,00:28:03.310,我还是想和姐姐做伴,00:28:03.200,00:28:05.200,I'd like to be her companion.
00:28:07.200,00:28:10.310,碎玉轩只住着臣妾一人怪冷清的,00:28:08.140,00:28:11.440,Living alone in the Palace of Pearl Jade is rather cold and cheerless.
00:28:10.880,00:28:12.430,若能和淳常在做伴,,,
00:28:12.840,00:28:13.990,臣妾也很高兴,00:28:11.940,00:28:15.020,I'd be delighted to have Attendant Chun by my side.
00:28:15.240,00:28:16.990,你要搬过去自然是好,00:28:16.340,00:28:18.540,It'd be great if you move back.
00:28:18.160,00:28:19.510,如果宫中每一个人,,,
00:28:19.800,00:28:21.870,都像你们姐妹这么好的关系,00:28:18.800,00:28:24.800,"It would put my mind at peace if all the concubines
had such a good relationship as you two."
00:28:22.160,00:28:23.990,那本宫就可安心了,,,
00:28:27.320,00:28:28.350,这是要搬走,,,
00:28:29.040,00:28:30.470,淳常在的东西谁敢碰坏了,00:28:28.160,00:28:29.840,She is moving out?
00:28:30.760,00:28:31.630,是是是 淳常在不比别人,00:28:30.120,00:28:32.420,"- Be most careful with Attendant Chun's belongings?
- Yes, yes."
00:28:32.000,00:28:33.990,淳常在这人小机灵倒大,00:28:32.540,00:28:35.400,Attendant Chun is young but not dumb.
00:28:34.480,00:28:37.270,才几天呀 就要拣着高枝飞了,00:28:35.440,00:28:38.040,"She ""flew to a high branch"" in only a  few days!"
00:28:38.200,00:28:39.670,淳常在不是这样的人,,,
00:28:40.160,00:28:41.230,她只是喜欢热闹,00:28:39.220,00:28:41.060,Attendant Chun isn’t that kind of person.
00:28:41.640,00:28:42.390,想换个地方住,00:28:41.200,00:28:43.160,It's just that she likes to live in a lively place.
00:28:42.680,00:28:45.070,我也爱热闹也想换个地方住,00:28:43.340,00:28:46.060,I'd like that too.
00:28:45.520,00:28:46.470,可有这么方便,,,
00:28:47.320,00:28:49.910,她倒好 仗着皇上喜欢,00:28:46.460,00:28:48.340,But is it just as simple for me?
00:28:50.400,00:28:52.550,求了皇后自个儿就搬了,00:28:48.440,00:28:53.460,"Now that she's in His Majesty's favor,
all she had to do is ask."
00:28:53.160,00:28:55.350,碎玉轩地方小又偏僻,00:28:54.300,00:28:56.600,The Palace of Pearl Jade is small and far off.
00:28:55.720,00:28:57.390,还是姐姐这里地气最好,00:28:56.740,00:28:58.620,It couldn't compare to your palace.
00:28:57.800,00:28:59.910,谁不知道这眼下除了华妃,,,
00:29:00.240,00:29:01.230,就是她俩得宠,00:28:58.840,00:29:02.160,"Other than Consort Fleur, no one but
these two are in His Majesty's favor."
00:29:01.520,00:29:03.790,这一抱成团就更方便邀宠了,00:29:02.360,00:29:05.060,Now it's even easier for them huddling together.
00:29:05.000,00:29:07.670,你和淳常在是同时进宫的,,,
00:29:08.000,00:29:09.710,又是莞贵人亲自举荐的,00:29:05.700,00:29:10.900,"Attendant Chun and you entered the palace at the same time,
and you both were recommended by Lady Sourire."
00:29:10.240,00:29:12.070,这次她只邀了淳常在同住,,,
00:29:12.400,00:29:13.270,而不邀你,00:29:11.140,00:29:14.560,But now she invited Attendant Chun only and not you.
00:29:14.200,00:29:15.710,你也不想想为什么,00:29:15.240,00:29:17.720,You better ask yourself why.
00:29:23.000,00:29:23.830,安姐姐,,,
00:29:25.080,00:29:27.110,这么冷的天你怎么站在这儿啊,00:29:23.980,00:29:25.740,Lingrong!
00:29:28.440,00:29:30.510,外头乱糟糟的我出来看一眼,00:29:26.120,00:29:28.940,Why are you standing here in the cold ?
00:29:31.240,00:29:33.310,对了这里也挺好的,00:29:29.560,00:29:31.960,It was so busy outside that I came to have a look.
00:29:33.760,00:29:34.750,离碎玉轩又近,,,
00:29:35.360,00:29:36.910,何必搬来搬去的麻烦,00:29:32.400,00:29:37.700,"I wanted to ask you why you'd bother to move.
This is a nice place and close to the Palace of Pearl Jade."
00:29:37.480,00:29:38.870,我和莞姐姐都爱热闹,,,
00:29:39.240,00:29:40.110,自然更合得来,00:29:38.460,00:29:41.760,"Sourire and I both like to live in a lively place.
That's why we get along."
00:29:41.120,00:29:43.150,是啊 出身差不多,,,
00:29:43.640,00:29:44.990,性子更合得来些,00:29:42.240,00:29:46.840,"Indeed, you two have similar personalities ...
when you come from similar families."
00:29:47.280,00:29:48.790,姐姐身子不好快回去吧,00:29:48.000,00:29:50.740,Please go back quickly if you don't feel well.
00:29:51.680,00:29:52.510,你先忙去吧,,,
00:29:52.880,00:29:53.590,好,00:29:52.800,00:29:54.560,You're busy. You should go in too.
,,,00:29:54.560,00:29:55.760,All right.
00:30:08.760,00:30:10.430,小主皇后娘娘来了,00:30:09.860,00:30:11.540,"My Lady, Her Majesty is here."
00:30:11.720,00:30:12.750,快请娘娘进来,00:30:12.880,00:30:14.920,Show Her Majesty in quickly.
00:30:22.440,00:30:24.150,皇后娘娘万福金安,00:30:23.640,00:30:26.540,May peace and grace be with Your Majesty.
00:30:26.600,00:30:27.470,起来吧,,,
00:30:27.840,00:30:28.670,谢娘娘,00:30:27.280,00:30:28.480,Rise.
00:30:30.040,00:30:32.350,本宫这两天早说你有点咳嗽,00:30:29.020,00:30:30.860,I thank Your Majesty.
00:30:34.040,00:30:35.950,刚正好看了端妃过来,00:30:31.000,00:30:34.300,I heard that you got a little cough in the last couple of days.
00:30:36.280,00:30:37.510,顺道来看看你,00:30:35.080,00:30:38.520,So I dropped by after visiting Consort Honnête.
00:30:38.360,00:30:39.870,臣妾只是不敌风寒,,,
00:30:40.280,00:30:41.390,咳嗽两声而已,00:30:39.540,00:30:42.640,"It's only a chill from the cold wind, and I had a few mild coughs."
00:30:41.920,00:30:43.150,有劳娘娘费心了,00:30:42.940,00:30:44.500,I made Your Majesty worry about me.
00:30:43.400,00:30:45.750,你这么年轻 要小心注意身体,00:30:44.500,00:30:46.960,You are so young. You ought to take care of your health.
00:30:46.320,00:30:48.430,千万不要落得端妃这样子,00:30:47.280,00:30:49.340,You must not to get ill like Consort Honnête.
00:30:48.720,00:30:50.430,本宫看着心疼啊,00:30:49.600,00:30:51.740,That would make my heart ache.
00:30:52.360,00:30:53.190,剪秋,,,
00:30:53.400,00:30:54.070,小主,00:30:53.300,00:30:54.500,Autumn.
00:30:54.560,00:30:56.790,这是山东巡抚进献的东阿阿胶,00:30:54.540,00:30:57.980,"My Lady, this is the Donge ejiao [donkey-hide gelatin]
sent by the Governor of Shandong."
00:30:57.560,00:30:59.030,娘娘自己都不舍得用,,,
00:30:59.280,00:31:00.950,特地吩咐奴婢留给小主,00:30:58.660,00:31:02.160,"Her Majesty was reluctant to use it herself,
and especially saved it for you."
00:31:02.000,00:31:03.350,多谢娘娘厚爱,00:31:03.060,00:31:05.380,I thank Your Majesty for your generous favor.
00:31:07.360,00:31:10.030,你这屋子冬冷夏热,00:31:08.460,00:31:11.180,Your palace is chilly in the winter and stuffy in the summer.
00:31:10.280,00:31:12.670,幸好炭烧得暖倒也不碍事,00:31:11.340,00:31:14.260,"Fortunately, the burning charcoal warms it up properly."
00:31:13.400,00:31:15.350,记得当时你们入宫,00:31:14.420,00:31:16.520,"I remember when you just moved in,"
00:31:15.720,00:31:18.830,华妃分配居处打点上下,00:31:16.840,00:31:19.940,"it was Consort Fleur who had
assigned the residences all by herself."
00:31:19.120,00:31:20.430,难免有所失误,,,
00:31:21.160,00:31:22.590,你也别往心里去,00:31:20.160,00:31:22.040,It was hard to avoid faults.
00:31:22.960,00:31:23.990,有娘娘关怀,00:31:22.140,00:31:23.960,Don't take it to heart.
00:31:24.400,00:31:26.270,臣妾不敢再有过多的要求,00:31:23.960,00:31:27.360,"With Your Majesty's solicitude,
I dare not ask for more."
00:31:26.720,00:31:28.070,已经心满意足了,00:31:27.800,00:31:29.140,I'm content already.
00:31:28.280,00:31:30.470,你看你是最谦和有礼,00:31:29.240,00:31:31.600,See? You are most modest and polite.
00:31:30.760,00:31:32.510,本宫是打心眼里喜欢你,00:31:31.600,00:31:34.100,I like you from the heart.
00:31:33.760,00:31:35.470,本宫却也心疼你,00:31:34.960,00:31:36.880,I'm also worried about you.
00:31:35.880,00:31:39.150,怕你凡事闪避自己吃亏呀,00:31:36.880,00:31:40.260,"I'm afraid that you are too unassuming
and being taken advantage of."
00:31:40.320,00:31:43.230,有娘娘心疼 臣妾不会吃亏,00:31:41.180,00:31:44.560,That won't happen with Your Majesty's grace.
00:31:44.080,00:31:45.310,还说不会吃亏,,,
00:31:45.800,00:31:47.310,你看你手怪冷的,00:31:45.120,00:31:46.720,Is that so?
00:31:47.920,00:31:49.190,来快躺下吧,00:31:46.960,00:31:48.960,Your hands are freezing.
,,,00:31:48.960,00:31:51.140,"Here, lie down quickly."
00:31:57.960,00:31:58.910,这是什么呀,,,
00:31:59.080,00:31:59.790,娘娘,00:31:59.000,00:32:00.360,What's this?
,,,00:32:00.360,00:32:01.800,Your Majesty!
00:32:04.680,00:32:06.910,你们都出去千万不要胡说,00:32:05.740,00:32:08.240,"All of you, get out and don't talk any nonsense."
00:32:07.120,00:32:07.830,是,00:32:08.300,00:32:09.420,"Yes, Your Majesty."
00:32:20.240,00:32:21.310,这个玉坠子,00:32:21.120,00:32:22.920,This jade pendant ...
00:32:21.960,00:32:26.830,本宫记得是华妃送给你,00:32:22.960,00:32:27.340,I remember Consort Fleur sent one for you
00:32:27.480,00:32:28.790,还有莞贵人的,,,
00:32:29.560,00:32:30.550,每人一个,00:32:27.760,00:32:31.500,and one for Lady Sourire.
00:32:32.240,00:32:35.230,你竟然拿这个玉坠子做诅咒,00:32:32.880,00:32:36.340,You went as far as to put a curse on this pendant.
00:32:35.760,00:32:37.190,你到底是诅咒华妃,00:32:36.480,00:32:38.640,Who on earth did you put the curse on?
00:32:37.680,00:32:39.030,还是诅咒莞贵人呢,00:32:38.640,00:32:40.580,Consort Fleur? Or Lady Sourire?
00:32:41.480,00:32:44.990,娘娘 莞姐姐与臣妾情同姐妹,00:32:42.400,00:32:43.820,Your Majesty.
,,,00:32:43.900,00:32:45.900,Lady Sourire and I are just like sisters.
00:32:45.520,00:32:47.870,臣妾万死也不敢诅咒莞姐姐呀,00:32:46.500,00:32:49.140,I would die a thousand deaths if I cursed Sourire.
00:32:48.280,00:32:49.190,是华妃,00:32:49.300,00:32:51.180,So you cursed Consort Fleur?
00:32:50.640,00:32:52.910,你有几条命去诅咒华妃呀,00:32:51.600,00:32:54.320,How many spare lives do you have to curse Consort Fleur?
00:32:53.400,00:32:54.390,到底为什么,00:32:54.380,00:32:56.000,And why?
00:32:55.040,00:32:58.870,娘娘 华妃对臣妾百般折辱,00:32:56.100,00:33:00.020,"Your Majesty, Consort Fleur humiliated me in every possible way."
00:32:59.720,00:33:02.590,驱之如婢 臣妾实在,00:33:00.800,00:33:03.480,She treated me like a maid. I really can't ...
00:33:02.720,00:33:03.430,荒唐,00:33:03.620,00:33:05.060,Absurd!
00:33:05.120,00:33:07.110,本宫一向以为你聪明乖觉,00:33:06.100,00:33:07.800,I all along considered you smart and prudent.
00:33:07.640,00:33:08.950,想不到如此糊涂,00:33:07.800,00:33:10.340,I never expected such foolishness from you.
00:33:09.600,00:33:11.950,敢在宫中行诅咒之术,00:33:10.560,00:33:13.200,You dare to practice malediction in the palace.
00:33:12.480,00:33:14.950,臣妾愚昧 还请娘娘宽恕,00:33:13.340,00:33:16.100,I beg Your Majesty's pardon for my  ignorance.
00:33:15.240,00:33:17.470,不但愚昧 而且愚不可及,00:33:16.180,00:33:18.820,"Not only ignorance, this is utter stupidity."
00:33:18.040,00:33:19.390,若被华妃看见了,,,
00:33:19.720,00:33:20.990,你这条命还要不要,00:33:19.080,00:33:22.360,You'd be dead if Consort Fleur saw this!
00:33:22.680,00:33:25.870,这种诅咒之术不过依赖鬼神,00:33:23.640,00:33:27.080,"However, malediction is dependant on evil spirits."
00:33:26.400,00:33:28.990,但你的祸福性命只在你自己手里,00:33:27.460,00:33:30.400,Your fate and your life are in your own hands.
00:33:29.520,00:33:31.750,如果诅咒之术真有用的话,00:33:30.640,00:33:32.920,"If curses ever worked,"
00:33:31.960,00:33:34.470,天下之人都不必长脑子用心思了,00:33:33.000,00:33:35.840,no one in the world would have to use their brains.
00:33:35.600,00:33:36.670,臣妾糊涂,00:33:36.420,00:33:37.720,I was fatuous.
00:33:39.840,00:33:42.430,本宫无心理会你有多恨华妃,00:33:40.940,00:33:43.900,I wouldn't care about how much you hate Consort Fleur.
00:33:43.120,00:33:44.590,本宫只想告诉你,00:33:44.120,00:33:46.140,"But I have to tell you,"
00:33:45.480,00:33:47.270,与其费心于诅咒之术,00:33:46.440,00:33:48.400,"instead of racking your brain with curses,"
00:33:47.760,00:33:51.230,不如用心讨好皇上来得事半功倍,00:33:48.580,00:33:52.360,"earning favor from His Majesty
will ""gain you twice as much with half the work""."
00:33:52.480,00:33:53.390,臣妾知借,00:33:53.360,00:33:55.880,"Your Majesty, I admit my fault."
00:33:57.040,00:33:58.070,这傻孩子,00:33:58.080,00:34:00.020,You were being silly.
00:34:01.200,00:34:03.790,拿去烧了 本宫只当没看见,00:34:02.020,00:34:04.800,Burn this. I will act like I saw nothing.
00:34:04.520,00:34:07.190,臣妾感激娘娘眷顾,00:34:05.460,00:34:09.260,I sincerely thank Your Majesty's grace.
00:34:08.960,00:34:11.750,你弧在宫中难免凄凉,00:34:09.900,00:34:13.780,You must feel lonely in the palace.
00:34:14.600,00:34:16.910,纵然有莞贵人这样的姐妹,00:34:15.240,00:34:18.400,"Even though Lady Sourire treats you like a sister,"
00:34:17.600,00:34:18.790,可她深得恩宠,,,
00:34:19.320,00:34:21.630,恐怕也不能事事顾及到你,00:34:18.580,00:34:22.540,"she cannot attend to everything for you
due to her high status in the palace."
00:34:21.920,00:34:23.190,你若以后再有委屈,,,
00:34:23.560,00:34:24.590,就向本宫倾诉,00:34:22.880,00:34:25.640,You can pour out your grievances to me in the future.
00:34:25.440,00:34:28.390,不许再有这样糊涂的念头了,00:34:26.520,00:34:29.440,You must not have any stupid ideas like this.
00:34:29.120,00:34:30.510,娘娘眷顾臣妾,,,
00:34:31.400,00:34:34.470,臣妾铭记在心没齿不忘,00:34:30.260,00:34:34.120,"I shall never forget the great grace
Your Majesty bestowed upon me."
00:34:35.240,00:34:37.790,好吧 先起来吧 地上冷,00:34:36.260,00:34:39.540,All right. You may rise. It's cold on the floor.
00:34:42.480,00:34:45.830,今天的事好在有人告诉本宫,00:34:43.200,00:34:46.960,"Luckily, someone told me about this."
00:34:46.160,00:34:47.830,要不然本宫也不知道,00:34:47.300,00:34:48.920,"Otherwise, I wouldn’t have known."
00:34:48.080,00:34:52.510,臣妾斗胆问娘娘一句是谁,00:34:49.060,00:34:53.800,May I humbly ask Your Majesty who it was?
00:34:53.440,00:34:55.630,自然是与你亲爱的姐妹呀,00:34:54.620,00:34:56.980,"It was your dear sister, clearly."
00:34:56.440,00:34:58.150,不过她也不是有心的,,,
00:34:58.400,00:34:59.430,她也很无奈,00:34:57.500,00:35:00.760,She had no ill intentions. She just couldn't help.
00:35:00.560,00:35:02.550,本宫已经跟她嘱咐好了,,,
00:35:03.320,00:35:05.830,这件事情到本宫这里,00:35:01.480,00:35:08.240,I have told her that this secret shall never go beyond us.
00:35:06.160,00:35:07.390,就到此为止了,,,
00:35:07.920,00:35:08.910,是莞姐姐吗,,,
00:35:09.320,00:35:10.390,你就别再问了,00:35:08.800,00:35:10.080,Was it Sourire?
,,,00:35:10.080,00:35:11.780,Stop asking!
00:35:11.080,00:35:14.350,现在养好身体什么都容易办了,00:35:12.100,00:35:16.380,"Your priority now is to restore your health
and that will make everything easier."
00:35:17.360,00:35:18.750,臣妾恭送娘娘,00:35:18.760,00:35:21.300,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:35:34.800,00:35:36.190,小主该吃药了,00:35:35.720,00:35:38.320,"My Lady, it’s time for medicine."
00:35:41.760,00:35:49.430,小主,00:35:43.280,00:35:44.580,My Lady …
00:35:49.760,00:35:51.110,吃里扒外的东西,00:35:49.320,00:35:50.500,My Lady!
00:35:51.880,00:35:53.350,奴婢不知道做错了什么,00:35:50.700,00:35:52.160,Traitor!
00:35:53.880,00:35:55.510,当请小主责罚,00:35:52.820,00:35:54.820,"My Lady, I don’t know what I have done wrong."
00:35:56.720,00:35:58.550,可吃里扒外这句话,00:35:54.820,00:35:56.820,"Punish me if you will, My Lady."
00:35:58.960,00:36:00.670,奴婢实在不敢当啊,00:35:57.780,00:36:01.700,But I would never dare to betray you!
00:36:01.080,00:36:03.230,我的寝殿向来都是你收拾的,00:36:02.020,00:36:04.320,"You are the only one who cleans my chamber,"
00:36:03.480,00:36:05.430,我宫中有什么也是你最清楚,00:36:04.440,00:36:06.660,and the only one who knows what I have here!
00:36:05.960,00:36:07.550,还敢强嘴说不知道,,,
00:36:08.120,00:36:09.230,小主息怒,00:36:06.980,00:36:09.180,How dare you pretend you don't know!
00:36:09.800,00:36:11.750,奴婢是为小主打扫寝殿,00:36:09.180,00:36:10.860,"Please don’t be angry, My Lady."
00:36:12.280,00:36:13.670,可近日小主的床铺,00:36:10.920,00:36:13.380,"It is my job to clean the chamber for you, My Lady."
00:36:14.040,00:36:15.230,都不许奴婢动手,00:36:13.420,00:36:16.680,But lately you didn’t allow me to make your bed.
00:36:15.760,00:36:17.590,不知道少了什么还是怎么的,,,
00:36:18.000,00:36:19.230,奴婢实在不知道啊,00:36:16.800,00:36:20.420,I have no idea whether anything is missing or not.
00:36:20.000,00:36:22.310,再说能进入这间寝殿的,,,
00:36:22.640,00:36:23.470,不止奴婢一人,00:36:21.140,00:36:24.340,"Besides, I'm not the only one who can enter your chamber."
00:36:23.800,00:36:24.670,还有菊青,,,
00:36:25.200,00:36:26.470,若真是少了什么,00:36:24.340,00:36:26.060,Daisy could too.
00:36:27.000,00:36:29.110,也不止奴婢一人有嫌疑,00:36:26.520,00:36:30.220,"If something is really missing, then I'm not the only suspect."
00:36:29.360,00:36:30.070,菊青,,,
00:36:30.760,00:36:31.550,是啊,00:36:30.400,00:36:31.560,Daisy?
,,,00:36:31.620,00:36:32.680,Yes.
00:36:31.840,00:36:35.350,前几日小主您说冷要换厚被子,00:36:32.740,00:36:36.340,"My Lady, when you said that you
wanted thicker quilts a few days ago."
00:36:36.200,00:36:38.390,可不是菊青进来整理的吗,00:36:37.280,00:36:40.140,It was Daisy who brought them in!
00:36:39.720,00:36:41.590,还好奴婢记得您的吩咐,,,
00:36:42.080,00:36:43.510,让她放在这儿就成,00:36:40.680,00:36:44.780,"It wasn't a problem. I remembered your order, My Lady,"
00:36:43.880,00:36:46.390,小主的床铺不许别人动手,00:36:44.800,00:36:47.740,and asked her to leave away from the bed.
00:36:46.640,00:36:51.270,是啊 还有菊青,00:36:47.780,00:36:49.560,Yes...
,,,00:36:51.100,00:36:53.820,There was Daisy.
00:36:53.000,00:36:56.150,她原本可是姐姐身边的人,00:36:54.080,00:36:57.700,She was from Sourire’s palace.
00:36:58.800,00:37:01.910,宝鹃快起来让我看看你的伤,00:36:59.780,00:37:02.760,"Coua, stand up quickly and let me see if I hurt you."
00:37:02.160,00:37:02.950,奴婢不敢,00:37:02.760,00:37:04.720,I don’t deserve it.
00:37:04.280,00:37:07.190,都是我不好下手重了些,00:37:05.160,00:37:08.240,I’m to blame for such a heavy hand.
00:37:08.360,00:37:11.550,可是宝鹃就为着你是我的心腹,,,
00:37:11.920,00:37:13.270,我下手才这样重,00:37:09.300,00:37:14.560,"But Coua, it was because I trusted you
that I slapped you so badly."
00:37:14.440,00:37:16.430,我生怕我身边那个通风报信,,,
00:37:16.760,00:37:18.230,吃里扒外的人是你,00:37:15.620,00:37:19.220,I'd be terrified if the traitor was you!
00:37:19.120,00:37:22.150,小主 奴婢不敢哪,00:37:20.140,00:37:23.400,"My Lady, I wouldn’t have the nerve for it."
00:37:24.400,00:37:26.590,我盼着不是你,00:37:25.100,00:37:27.780,I’m so relieved it wasn't you.
00:37:29.000,00:37:30.710,但是也没有想到是菊青,00:37:29.980,00:37:32.300,But I didn’t expect that it would be Daisy.
00:37:31.080,00:37:33.630,小主你怀疑菊青,00:37:32.420,00:37:34.920,"My Lady, do you suspect her?"
00:37:34.200,00:37:36.150,她原本就是姐姐身边的人,00:37:35.360,00:37:37.540,She was a servant of Sourire.
00:37:37.040,00:37:39.590,除了她再没别人了,00:37:37.900,00:37:41.000,There’s no other possibility.
00:37:42.000,00:37:44.830,我原以为姐姐是为了我好,,,
00:37:45.400,00:37:46.990,才把她送来伺候我,00:37:43.200,00:37:48.140,I thought that Sourire had sent her only to take care of me.
00:37:48.600,00:37:52.510,没想到她是要在我眼皮底下,,,
00:37:53.600,00:37:54.870,插个钉子,00:37:51.840,00:37:55.780,I never expected her to put a thorn in my side.
00:38:00.640,00:38:01.590,我记得内务府,,,
00:38:01.840,00:38:03.230,送来两件水獭皮褂子,00:38:01.600,00:38:04.460,I recall that the Household Department sent two otter fur-lined gowns.
00:38:04.080,00:38:05.510,你记得送到敬嫔那儿去,00:38:04.640,00:38:06.900,Remember to bring them to Concubine Estime.
00:38:05.960,00:38:06.830,一件给她,,,
00:38:07.360,00:38:09.590,一件照样请她悄悄送去给眉姐姐,00:38:07.040,00:38:10.520,"One is for her, and ask her to
send the other to Meizhuang secretly ."
00:38:10.240,00:38:11.030,我知道了,,,
00:38:12.360,00:38:13.870,原想着敬嫔督管,00:38:10.780,00:38:12.280,I will.
00:38:14.360,00:38:15.870,得空还能去看看眉姐姐,00:38:13.300,00:38:16.800,I was planning to call on Meizhuang when Concubine Estime is supervising.
00:38:16.720,00:38:18.070,可恨华妃盯得紧,,,
00:38:18.400,00:38:19.550,竟一点空子都不漏,00:38:17.880,00:38:21.340,"But Consort Fleur is watching so closely
that she doesn't miss a thing."
00:38:20.920,00:38:22.070,小主宽心吧,,,
00:38:22.440,00:38:24.030,等过了年下一开春,00:38:21.560,00:38:23.380,"My Lady, please don’t worry."
00:38:24.440,00:38:26.150,小主寻个皇上高兴的时候,00:38:23.480,00:38:27.060,"When next spring starts, you could find a chance
when His Majesty is in a good mood"
00:38:26.560,00:38:28.270,再劝他把眉小主放了就是,00:38:27.240,00:38:29.540,and ask him to release Meizhuang.
00:38:29.840,00:38:31.190,得空还要叮嘱府里,,,
00:38:31.760,00:38:32.750,刘畚一定要抓住,00:38:30.720,00:38:32.680,"When you get a chance, remember to keep urging my family"
00:38:33.160,00:38:33.870,是,00:38:32.760,00:38:34.120,that they must capture Liu Ben.
00:38:34.360,00:38:35.310,小主快走吧,00:38:34.240,00:38:35.220,Yes.
00:38:35.560,00:38:36.870,早说太后也要出席,00:38:35.340,00:38:36.320,"Let's go, My Lady."
00:38:37.200,00:38:38.190,连十七爷都回来了,00:38:36.320,00:38:38.080,I heard that the Empress Dowager will also be attending.
00:38:38.760,00:38:39.950,咱们若迟了可不好,00:38:38.240,00:38:40.000,Even Lord XVII has returned.
00:38:40.520,00:38:41.230,走吧,00:38:40.000,00:38:42.000,It'd be impolite to be late.
,,,00:38:42.000,00:38:43.140,Let's go.
00:38:42.360,00:38:44.910,儿臣此行去了剑阁梓潼的古栈道,00:38:43.380,00:38:45.940,"Your Majesty, in this trip, I went to the
ancient plank road from Jiange to Zitong,"
00:38:45.280,00:38:46.390,李冰的都江堰,,,
00:38:46.680,00:38:48.470,还有杜甫的浣花居所,00:38:45.940,00:38:47.660,and to Dujiangyan [an ancient irrigation system].
00:38:49.600,00:38:51.270,千佛岩可看了吗,00:38:47.660,00:38:50.300,I also visited Du Fu's thatched cottage by the Huanhua Creek.
00:38:51.680,00:38:53.550,儿臣知道皇额娘心念佛事,00:38:50.760,00:38:52.580,Did you visit the Thousand-Buddha Cliff?
00:38:53.920,00:38:55.350,已经替皇额娘一一拜过,00:38:52.720,00:38:54.800,I know Your Majesty is devoted to the Buddha
00:38:56.480,00:38:58.150,难为你一片孝心,00:38:54.940,00:38:57.320,so I worshipped them one by one on your behalf.
,,,00:38:57.500,00:38:59.820,I appreciate your filial piety.
00:38:59.200,00:39:01.750,蜀道难于上青天,00:39:00.000,00:39:02.520,"""The road to Shu is harder than climbing to the sky.""
[from a poem by Li Bai.]"
00:39:02.120,00:39:03.550,你此行辛苦了,00:39:03.000,00:39:05.120,It must be a difficult trip for you.
00:39:07.720,00:39:09.590,华妃这件衣裳不借,00:39:08.640,00:39:11.080,"Consort Fleur is beautifully dressed today,"
00:39:10.360,00:39:12.070,哀家虽然眼神不好,00:39:11.240,00:39:13.360,"Even though I have a poor eyesight,"
00:39:12.640,00:39:14.750,都觉着光彩夺目,00:39:13.480,00:39:15.920,I can see how dazzling it is.
00:39:17.440,00:39:19.030,太后赏了那支步摇,,,
00:39:19.400,00:39:21.230,臣妾想着得有些好衣裳配,00:39:18.560,00:39:23.260,"I thought I must complement the step swing
Your Majesty awarded me with beautiful clothes."
00:39:21.640,00:39:22.510,才相得益彰,,,
00:39:23.000,00:39:25.350,所以让绣院新做了几身,00:39:23.800,00:39:26.420,So I ordered some from the Embroidery Department.
00:39:25.920,00:39:28.150,什么衣裳得配什么首饰,00:39:26.700,00:39:29.420,Good jewellery must go with good clothes.
00:39:28.520,00:39:31.270,本宫看华妃簪的绢花,,,
00:39:31.800,00:39:33.270,也价值不菲呀,00:39:29.480,00:39:34.260,"That silk flower you're wearing, I can tell, is also priceless."
00:39:33.760,00:39:36.470,宫中簪发的绢花都是绸缎做的,00:39:34.480,00:39:37.620,The flower hairpins in the palace are all made of fabric.
00:39:37.000,00:39:39.470,虽然好看却容易腐坏,00:39:38.060,00:39:40.860,They look pretty but are easy to spoil.
00:39:39.920,00:39:42.350,臣妾用的是金线密织,00:39:41.040,00:39:43.560,Mine is densely woven with gold thread
00:39:42.760,00:39:44.470,穿宝石珠子做的,00:39:43.560,00:39:45.500,and studded with jewels and pearls.
00:39:45.320,00:39:48.870,的确好看 但是花费也不小吧,00:39:46.500,00:39:50.460,It definitely looks nice. But it must have cost a lot.
00:39:51.000,00:39:52.510,多谢皇后关怀,00:39:51.000,00:39:53.720,I thank Your Majesty for your concern.
00:39:52.960,00:39:54.990,臣妾家里好歹有些贴补,00:39:54.000,00:39:56.180,"After all, my family subsidizes me."
00:39:55.400,00:39:56.710,不必费宫中的钱,00:39:56.260,00:39:58.660,I need not use the palace's money.
00:39:58.800,00:40:01.950,都像华妃一样有个好娘家才好呢,00:39:59.680,00:40:03.160,If only everyone had a family like Consort Fleur's!
00:40:02.480,00:40:04.390,就不用守着月例银子,,,
00:40:04.720,00:40:05.870,过得紧巴巴的,00:40:03.320,00:40:07.500,There'd be no need for frugality over the tight monthly stipends.
00:40:08.440,00:40:10.030,臣妾娘家再好,,,
00:40:10.480,00:40:12.110,也是得皇上赏识,00:40:09.500,00:40:13.280,My family would be nothing without His Majesty's appreciation.
00:40:12.960,00:40:14.830,年羹尧就你这么一个妹妹,00:40:13.580,00:40:15.980,You're Nian Gengyao's only sister.
00:40:15.120,00:40:17.030,自然是朕赏赐他什么,,,
00:40:17.400,00:40:18.470,他都贴补给你了,00:40:16.000,00:40:20.060,He would surely pass on anything I rewarded to you.
00:40:21.720,00:40:24.350,太后 您服药的时间到了,00:40:22.640,00:40:25.440,"Your Majesty, it's time for medicine."
00:40:24.680,00:40:26.470,太医还在宫中等着呢,00:40:25.500,00:40:27.820,The imperial doctor is waiting for you.
00:40:27.600,00:40:28.390,皇帝,,,
00:40:28.840,00:40:31.830,哀家觉得不太舒服就先回去了,00:40:28.660,00:40:32.700,I'm not feeling very well. I have to leave now.
00:40:32.040,00:40:33.510,皇额娘要保重身子,,,
00:40:33.800,00:40:34.950,儿子才能放心,00:40:32.980,00:40:34.740,"Take care of yourself, Mother."
,,,00:40:34.860,00:40:36.860,Then I can put my mind at ease.
00:40:41.880,00:40:43.950,恭送太后,00:40:42.920,00:40:45.320,I bid Your Majesty goodbye.
00:40:48.160,00:40:50.430,这是莞贵人新酿的美酒,00:40:49.240,00:40:51.480,This is the wine that Lady Sourire brewed.
00:40:50.720,00:40:51.710,大家一同尝尝,,,
00:40:52.800,00:40:54.230,这是桂花酒,00:40:51.500,00:40:53.740,Let's all have a taste of it.
00:40:57.200,00:40:59.310,朕与莞贵人一同采摘,00:40:53.880,00:40:56.300,This one is osmanthus wine.
00:40:59.560,00:41:02.350,今秋新开的桂花酿成此酒,00:40:58.180,00:41:03.280,"This autumn, Lady Sourire and I picked some
osmanthus flowers to make this wine."
00:41:03.680,00:41:05.190,难怪皇兄这般得意,00:41:04.500,00:41:06.500,No wonder Your Majesty was so proud
00:41:05.600,00:41:07.030,让我们大家都尝一尝,00:41:06.780,00:41:08.760,when you asked us to try it.
00:41:08.040,00:41:10.590,家宴之上众位王爷在座,00:41:09.000,00:41:11.840,"In an imperial feast with so much royalty present,"
00:41:11.160,00:41:14.510,桂花酒甜醉 但却略显简薄,00:41:12.000,00:41:15.480,the osmanthus wine is sweet but seems unremarkable.
00:41:15.320,00:41:17.910,若是以宫中珍藏的美酒待客,,,
00:41:18.240,00:41:19.830,岂不更显天家风范,00:41:16.380,00:41:21.220,"Wouldn't the imperial hospitality manifest better if the
guests are served with the treasured wine in the palace?"
00:41:20.840,00:41:22.190,西北战事初平,,,
00:41:22.520,00:41:24.630,自太后皇上起都节俭用度,00:41:21.740,00:41:23.780,The war in the northwest has just been quelled.
00:41:24.880,00:41:27.030,后宫理当与太后皇上共进退,00:41:23.840,00:41:25.840,"Since Their Majesties are very frugal,"
00:41:28.080,00:41:29.910,以皇上亲手所制的桂花酒,00:41:25.840,00:41:28.520,there is no reason that the harem should differ.
00:41:30.240,00:41:32.310,代替名贵酒种遍示亲贵,00:41:29.120,00:41:33.320,"We replaced the precious wine with
the osmanthus wine His Majesty brewed."
00:41:32.760,00:41:35.150,不仅是皇上节俭用度之心,00:41:33.820,00:41:36.200,"This not only shows His Majesty's virtues of thrift,"
00:41:35.360,00:41:37.310,更显皇室亲密无间,00:41:36.200,00:41:38.300,but also brings the extended family closer.
00:41:38.480,00:41:41.510,莞贵人提倡节俭那自然是很好的,00:41:39.480,00:41:42.600,"There's nothing wrong with advocating thrift, Lady Sourire."
00:41:42.080,00:41:42.510,可是早闻,,,
00:41:42.760,00:41:45.510,贵人有一双蜀锦绣成的玉鞋,00:41:43.000,00:41:46.540,"But I heard that you have a pair of
jade shoes made with Shu Brocade."
00:41:45.880,00:41:46.910,奢华无比,,,
00:41:47.200,00:41:48.310,不知道姐姐我,00:41:46.760,00:41:48.120,That is so luxurious.
00:41:48.600,00:41:50.350,是否有幸可以一观呢,00:41:48.300,00:41:52.060,I wonder if I would have the honor to admire them.
00:41:52.520,00:41:55.110,那是皇上喜欢莞姐姐才赐给她的,00:41:53.500,00:41:56.320,His Majesty adores Sourire and awarded her the shoes.
00:41:55.560,00:41:57.910,自然是越贵重越奢华越好喽,00:41:56.500,00:41:59.320,That is why they are expensive and luxurious.
00:41:58.240,00:42:00.350,既然皇上喜欢又有什么不可以呢,00:41:59.320,00:42:01.920,"There is nothing wrong with His Majesty's adoration,"
00:42:00.800,00:42:02.150,皇上您说是不是,00:42:01.920,00:42:03.820,"is there, Your Majesty?"
00:42:04.120,00:42:07.350,朕最喜欢 你有什么便说什么,00:42:05.000,00:42:08.820,I appreciate your frankness the best.
00:42:09.480,00:42:11.710,富察贵人你说是不是,00:42:10.460,00:42:13.040,"What do you think, Lady Fuca?"
00:42:13.640,00:42:15.390,淳常在说得不借,00:42:14.660,00:42:16.920,"You are right, Attendant Chun."
